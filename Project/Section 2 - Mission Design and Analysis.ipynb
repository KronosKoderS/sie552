    "The mission analysis and design shall show the elements of trajectory design. The key element of this section is to provide a detailed summary of the delta-v required to accomplish the missions. The delta-v required for attitude maneuvers shall be reported as a single delta-v and then you can refer to the ACS/Propulsion sections for detailed calculation of how the delta-v was derived. The following sections are expected to be included in the report.\n",

    "    * Describe your design process. Show the calculations for the final maneuvers. \n",

    "NOTE: the overall goal is to reduce the total amount of delta-V from 2.8 km/sec initial estimate (see SRD) to something in the range 1.4-1.6 km/sec (everything included). A simplified mission analysis  approach  has  been  reported  in  class.  You  can  also  provide  trajectory  design  from  previous missions (e.g. MGS, pathfinder, MRO). In this case,  you need to do a thorough research job to identify ALL delta-v required by the mission design. You need to also find graphs/plots of the  trajectory  and  report  a  summary  of  what  has  been  used  and  explain  how  the  former  design  fits your design. You can also implement a hybrid approach where you take portion of historical trajectories and design only some parts of the overall mission profile. \n"
