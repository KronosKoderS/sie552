    "The spacecraft propulsion subsystem section shall report on the process that culminates with the selection  of  the  propulsion  option  that  satisfies  the  propulsion  requirements.  You  need  to  define/select the set of thrusters and provide sizing for that, perform trade studies mono-prop vs bi-prop  vs.  dual  mode  and provide  a  final  mass  and  power  statement  for  the  subsystem  (MEL  with uncertainties). The following sections shall be included in the propulsion subsystem portion of the report:\n",
    "1. Propulsion requirements and design assumption \n",
    "2. Thrusters selection and sizing\n",
    "     * Assignment  #3  provided  a  guideline  for  the  type  of  thrusters  that  must  be  used  (low, medium and high thrust)\n",
    "     * State  mass  by  computing  specific  impulse  and  mass  of  each  single  thruster  (see  assignment #3). Compare with off-the-shelf options. \n",
    "3. Propulsion system trade studies\n",
    "    * Summarize the propulsion requirements in a table\n",
    "        * Summarize translational maneuver propellant (from mission analysis)\n",
    "        * Summarize attitude maneuver propellant (from ACS subsystem)\n",
    "    * Size a mono propellant system. Show the analysis\n",
    "    * Size a bi-propellant system. Show the analysis\n",
    "    * Size a dual mode system. Show the analysis.\n",
    "    * Discuss your selection.\n",
    "4. Propulsion system architecture and functional block diagram\n",
    "    * Summarize your selection\n",
    "5. Mass and power statement\n",
    "    * Summarize power and equipment/hardware that is required for your subsystem\n",
    "    * Report  a  propulsion  subsystem  MEL  with  uncertainties.  Discuss  if  you  use  calculated or off-the-shelf components with heritage from other missions.\n"
