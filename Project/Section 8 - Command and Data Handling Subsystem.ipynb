    "The spacecraft CDH section shall summarize your design effort in providing a suitable solution for  the  computational  needs  and  data  stream  of  your  spacecraft.  You  are  required  to  select  a  proper microprocessor,  a  solid  state  recorder  and  other  components  making  the  CHD  system.  The following sections shall be included in the CDH subsystem portion of the report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CDH requirements and design assumptions\n",
    "    * Determine maximum and minimum symbol rate for science and engineering data\n",
    "    * Determine solid state recorder capacity and rate capability requirements.\n",
    "2. CDH system component sizing process\n",
    "    * Select/size the proper microprocessor. Justify your selection\n",
    "    * Select/size the SSR. Justify your selection\n",
    "    * State what other hardware you need to complete the system\n",
    "3. CDH mass and power estimation\n",
    "    * Estimate mass and power based on recently flown CDH system.\n",
    "    * Prepare a CDH MEL and include uncertainties  \n",
    "4. CDH functional block diagram\n"
